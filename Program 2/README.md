Part 1. 

Read in a pay rate (in whole dollars).  Next read in 10 values for a person's weekly hours worked and print out the salaries with each number of hours worked. The salary is the base rate times the number of hours for the first 40 hours.  Then the pay rate is double time for all hours worked over 40.  Use a loop for reading in the 10 sets of hours.

Part 2. 

Same thing, but keep reading in hours (and printing pay amount) until a negative value is input for hours worked.
