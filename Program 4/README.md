# Program

Write an assembler language program with the following 6 functions:

1. Read in up to 10 integer values into an array.  The last value read in will be -9.  Do not include -9 in your array.  Of course, you will need to count how many values you read in (be sure you don't include the -9 in the count).
2. Find the sum of values in the array.
3. Find the integer average (do not pass sum, have average call sum).
4. Find the min value read in
5. Find the max value read in 
6. Count how many values are above the average and below the average.

The main will print out all the results.
