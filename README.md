# Spring-CSCI-211-

Everything included in this repository are coding projects/ assignments given to me during the CSCI 211 (Introduction to Assembly Language and Computer Architecture) course at Winthrop University. This repository is intended for education purposes. Each program contains more than needed commenting to provide a very detailed description of what the code is doing.  

All of the AL programs in this repository were written on a MARS - a MIPS assembler and simulator. 

To download this simulator, go to: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/
