# Assignment 

This assignment is in 2 parts to step you up to where you need to be.

# Program 1.    

This program is to let you become accustomed to the MARS Simulator.  Write a program that takes 3 values, a, b and c, (defined as variables in the data section with initial values), then computes b+(a-c) and prints out the result.  There should be good text output with the resulting number.

# Program 2.  

Read in two values from the keyboard.  Calculate and print out the sum, difference, product and quotient/remainder along with the original input values.  Run it with several test cases.  Try a test case where the two operands are 7 digits each (They can be held as a 32-bit register can hold 2^32 which is approximately 4,000,0000,000).  Explain why you get a strange result.
