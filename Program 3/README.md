# Program 

Write an assembler language program with the following 6 sections of code:

1. Read in up to 10 integer values into an array.  The last value read in will be -9.  Do not include -9 in your array.  Of course, you will need to count how many values you read in (be sure you don't include the -9 in the count).
2. Find the sum of values in the array.(after you have read them in, not while reading them in).
3. Find the integer average.
4. Find the min value read in (use its own loop)
5. Find the max value read in (use its own loop)
6. Count how many values are above the average and below the average (using its own loop)
7. Do each of these as 6 separate steps.  The read section should just do the reading (and counting).  Be sure you print out the results of each.

# Extra credit:

Sort the data and find the median (middle value or average of the two middle values if the count is even)

# Extra Extra credit:

Find the mode (the most frequently used value).
